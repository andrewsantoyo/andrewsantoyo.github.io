        <div id="about_me">
            <p>
                I’m currently a second-year software engineering major at UC Irvine. I was originally a math major,
                 but I realized that I really wanted to pursue software engineering. I enjoy how much it challenges
                  me and feel enthusiastic as the "aha" moments happen, when everything comes together and works. 
                  I have a passion for helping others, especially those who don’t believe they fit into the tech 
                  industry due to the lack of representation. I’m involved in the professional committee of the 
                  Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I’ve organized information sessions with 
                  companies like Boeing and Northrop Grumman and brought in Hispanic representatives to contribute 
                  their experiences. In addition, I’m interning at JPMorgan Chase & Co. this upcoming summer as a 
                  Software Engineering Summer Analyst, where I’ll gain hands-on experience. I’m constantly striving 
                  to learn more. For example, I have taken CodePath’s Intro to Mobile App Development course and 
                  JPMorgan’s Chase Virtual Experience.
